# What is ChimpCase?

Did you end up with a camelCase variable that you need to display to the user, but you don't want to spend 10 mins creating a helper function to format the text to be readable to humans?

Well, ChimpCase **is** your helper function! (Also supports PascalCase and snake_case)

# Installation

`npm install chimpcase`
